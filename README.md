# React Donation Progress Bar

This plugin aims to display visually the target and current fundraising values from a user's WordPress database from x-date to y-date.

## Description

From my limited understanding of custom gutenberg block types in wordpress development, one typically wraps a custom block type or types inside of a plugin to fully enscapsulate the block and allow for easier maintainability of the codebase. While this app serves simply as a single custom block, it will be exported as a plugin to a wordpress site.

## Requirements

-   Requires at least: WordPress 4.5
-   Tested up to: WordPress 6.7.1
-   Requires PHP: 5.6
